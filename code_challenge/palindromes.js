 * Try it with your reverseString function and then try to see if you can do it without reversing anything.
 * This might be a more roundabout way of solving the problem but it shows your knowledge of your tools and the kind of thinking that they are looking for

 * Find out how many words in the English language are palindromes

 * There is a file on your Mac (if you have a mac) at the path provided. Use node.js to read this file, and figure out the number of palindromes that there are in English and log it to the console.
